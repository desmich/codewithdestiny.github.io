                <p class="big-blurb">After completing every prerequisite for the nursing program and working in the hospital for 3.5 years, I ultimately 
                    decided that healthcare wasn't for me. I loved working with computers growing up, but only ever saw myself pursuing a healthcare career 
                    so I didn't know where to start to break into tech. My physiology professor, Dr. Heather Ashworth, told me about Tech-Moms which helped 
                    spur me in the right direction. After completing Tech-Moms, I intend to go to WGU for a computer science degree.
