                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>I was born in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, but I have spent
                        the majority of my life in Orem, Utah. I graduated from 
                        Timpanogos High School in 2019 while participating in their 
                        distance education program through Utah Valley University 
                        to earn college credit. After taking a short break from school, 
                        I went back to UVU to do prerequisites for nursing school, 
                        ended up changing my plan, and used the credits I earned to 
                        graduate with an Associate's in Science in 2023.

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>My biggest hobby currently is working with yarn by knitting 
                        or crocheting. I also enjoy making art in other ways, 
                        especially painting and journaling. Being outdoors is one 
                        of my favorite ways to pass the time. I enjoy trying to identify 
                        different bugs, trees, and flowers while I am hiking in the 
                        mountains.

                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>One of my biggest long-term goals in life is to move to the United 
                        Kingdom, and I am confident that a career in tech can help me 
                        achieve this. I would ideally like to move before 2030, but I am 
                        planning on trying to move sooner if possible. One of my 
                        current short-term goals is to start a Bachelor's in Computer 
                        Science through WGU in January, and I am intending to finish this 
                        within 1.5 years.
